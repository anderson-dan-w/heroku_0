A few people now have said to me "wow, what an interesting, eye-catching title
for your blog. I bet it means something deep and smart, because you're
obviously so intelligent" or things similar. Though I guess if we are going
for truth and honesty, rather than complete fiction, the quote would be more
along the lines of "I don't get it" or "I have never heard of your blog".

Besides the aural ambiguity of <code>in.sight.few.languish</code>, which could be
either <code>insightful language</code> or <code>insightful anguish</code>, there is an actual meaning
to the phrase I chose. It's a veiled reference to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>, which
was initially a pretty boring factory performance study that ended up yielding
an interesting psychological point, once it was finally discovered. 

Here's what went down:
In the 1920s, some factory owners told the employees they were bringing in an
outside group to do some measurement and analytics on how productive the
workforce was being, and to see what they could do to improve the situation.
As the story goes, no matter what the experimenters varied, productivity
always increased. Turn the lights a little brighter? More productive. Turn the
lights less bright? More productive. More frequent, shorter breaks? Less
frequent, longer breaks? Both more productive.

Now, you could just look at that data and think "wow, what a TERRIBLE company,
they managed to pick the absolutely least-productive settings, across the
board" and be done with it, and without any further data, it might be hard to
convincingly argue against such a conclusion.

The real kicker though, was that once the experiementers reported their
results (presumably scratching their heads), and left, the productivity rates
went abruptly down, back to initial levels. Now, nothing the management did
seemed to have any serious effect on the workers' productivity. 

It was eventually realized (by a psychologist by the name of Landsberger, in the
1950s, when reviewing this work) that the real changes in productivity had
little to do with the lighting or the breaks in the workday, but had everything
to do with the fact that the employees knew they were being watched. Since the
employees felt like someone was taking an interest in their work, they felt
more important and therefore performed better. While being watched (or one
might say <code>"in sight"</code>), not many (<code>"few"</code>) of them slacked off (<code>"languished"</code>).

Some corollaries to the Hawthorne effect are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golem_effect">golem effect</a>, and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">Pygmalion effect</a>, and they have some particularly far-reaching and important
implications. These complementary effects suggest that people tend to perform
better or worse in line with the expectations given to them. For the golem
effect, being presented with lower expectations leads to a decrease in
performance; the Pygmalion effect shows that those given high expectations tend
to perform better than they do on average.

So, why exactly would I pick a factory experiment from the 1920s as the
title of my blog? Because it is supposed to directly represent my motivating
factors for continuing to post: if I feel like there are people out there,
reading my blog, interested in what I have to say, I'll be more likely to
post regularly and to produce interesting thoughts. Now, there are probably
on the order of a few thousand things wrong with these assumptions, but I'll
leave those for another post.
