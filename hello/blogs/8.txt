And but so, this isn't my first time, as it were, reading David Foster Wallace or, for that matter, short stories of his, that is by (not 'of') David Foster Wallace (or 'DFW') and so I was prepared, or thought I was prepared, having read many short stories and a novel of his, for his writing style, but this particular short story, the <strike>eponymous</strike> title<sup>1</sup> story of the compendium, proved rather more difficult than had been previously expected due to, among other things, the constant redefining or, as it were, 'recasting' of words mid-sentence and also not, of course, surprisingly, his convoluted or 'digressionary' stream-of-consciousness sentence structure.

<i>Oblivion</i> is a short-ish story told from the perspective of Randall Napier who is having some marriage difficulties with his wife - she jolts awake every night, screaming at him to stop snoring, even though he's lying there, awake, too anxious to go to sleep for fear of getting yelled at. This is at least ostensibly the scene we are set, provided narration from Randall. He and his wife, Hope, along with her father, are taking cover from the thunderstorm that has just struck the golf course. Randall wants to broach this sensitive topic with his father-in-law, though to exactly what end is unclear (vindication? support?).

This interaction was the first aspect of the story that struck me with considerable force - the aloofness of Hope's father and the uncertainty, the lack of confidence, it causes in the narrator. Perhaps it's merely the projection of the reader, but it seemed to be such a realistic and nuanced view that I felt the awkwardness, the discomfort while reading it. He sums it up succinctly and painfully when describing the dismissive brush off when attempting to initiate the discussion: "Consciously or otherwise, it is a hand gesture ideally designed to make its recipient feel like an otiose moron or bore". What I think really brought it home, especially, was the prefix, that it might not have even be conscious or intentional.

The story continues to unfold, expounding upon the Father, his characteristics, his attitude, his (declining) health. The original plot, re: snoring, seems almost forgotten as we further digress into musings on the waitress, the other golfers, the statistics related to lightning-related deaths, the narrator's step-daughter moving off to college (due at least partly to his wife's/her mother's insistence). But then he ties it back in, and now about a third of the way through the story, we really dive in.

Randall goes on at length with his understanding of the situation and his justification for his feelings - he explains he's perfectly willing to accept blame, take responsibility, and work on modifying his behavior, but he assures us he isn't snoring. In <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n22/wyatt-mason/dont-like-it-you-dont-have-to-play">a review of Oblivion</a>, this is supposedly a way to make the narrator less likeable and less reliable.
