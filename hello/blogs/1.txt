One of the things I enjoying messing around with in computer science is words. I like writing quick-and-dirty programs to give me a list of words with some characteristic. For example, the following (python) code snippet would give me all words that contain all 5 vowels (<code>"AEIOU"</code>):
<pre><code class="python"># assuming I have a set/list of words, in all CAPS.
allVowels = set()
for word in WORDS:
    missing = False
    for vowel in "AEIOU":
        if vowel not in word:
            missing = true
            # break, if we want to prematurely optimize
    if not missing:
        allVowels.add(word)
</code></pre>

or, because I enjoy Python, and I enjoy being concise (while still being readable; this distinction is sure to come up in the future):
<pre><code>allVowels = {w for w in WORDS if all(v in w for v in "AEIOU")}
</code></pre>

and that's it. That provides me with a nice, long list (based on the word-lists I have) of over 2500 words with all the vowels. My list starts (when sorted alphabetically) with <code>ABOIDEAU</code>, passes through normal words like <code>EDUCATION</code>, <code>MOUNTAINEERING</code>, and <code>PNEUMONIA</code> and finally ends with <code>WAREHOUSING</code>.

This, to me, immediately points out a few things:
<ul>
<li>There are some weird words - I have never heard of <code>ABOIDEAU</code></li>
<li>Some of these words have the vowels more than once - two <code>E</code>s and <code>I</code>s in <code>MOUNTAINEERING</code>
<li> There aren't any words that start with <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, or <code>Z</code> that contains all the vowels.
</ul>

A follow up question might be "How many words use all the vowels exactly once?" Just a little tweak to the <code>set-comprehension</code>:

<pre><code> allVowelsOnce = {w for w in WORDS if all(1 == w.count(v) for v in "AEIOU")}</code></pre>

As an excuse to have something to graph, we can look at distribution by starting letter, and by length of word. To get my data:

<pre><code>import collections
byStart = collections.Counter(w[0] for w in allVowels)
byStartOnce = collections.Counter(w[0] for w in allVowelsOnce)
byLen = collections.Counter(len(w) for w in allVowels)
byLenOnce = collections.Counter(len(w) for w in allVowelsOnce)
</code></pre>
